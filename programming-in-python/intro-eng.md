# Briefly about the Python language
Python - a general-purpose high-level programming language. 
Its most important features:
- It has an extensive suite of standard libraries
- The main idea is clarity, readability and conciseness of the code
- Supports various paradigms: object-oriented (programs are defined using objects - elements that link state and behavior), imperative (the execution process as a sequence of instructions that change the state of the program), function-oriented (functions belong to basic values, and the emphasis is on valuing (often recursive) functions rather than executing commands)
- Has a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management
- Used as a scripting language - Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
- Developed as an open source project, managed by the Python Software Foundation (a non-profit organization)

# History of Python
- Developed in the early 1990s, its creator is Guido van Rossum
- It was supposed to be the successor of the ABC language
- The name is not derived from snakes, but from the comedy series - Monty Python's Flying Circus
- In 2000, version 2.0 was released. Since version 2.1, it has been released entirely by the Python Software Foundation - PSF (which owns all intellectual property), which is modeled on the Apache Software Foundation organization. 
- In 2008, version 3.0 was released, and as of 2020 is the only supported and continuously developed official version of the language.

# The most important applications of the Python language
- Web and Internet applications (Frameworks such as Django, Pyramid, Micro-frameworks such as Flask or Bottle, Advanced CMSs such as Plone and django CMS). Standard Python libraries support many Internet communication protocols (HTML and XML, JSON, email processing, FTP, IMAP, socket interfaces). Additional libraries provide many more capabilities (Request - powerful HTTP client library, Beautiful Soup - HTML parser, Feedparser - RSS/Atom parsing, Paramiko - implements SSH2 protocol, Twisted Python - framework for asynchronous web programming).
- Scientific and numerical computing (SciPy - a set of packages dedicated to mathematical, scientific and engineering applications, Pandas - a library dedicated to data analysis and statistical modeling, IPython - a powerful interactive shell supporting data visualization)
- Education (availability of many interesting introductory studies in computer science)
- Desktop applications with a graphical user interface (GUI) (availability of such libraries for user interface design and programming as Tk, wxWidgets, Kivy, Qt via pyqt or pyside, GTK+, Microsoft Foundation Classes via win32 extensions)
- Software development and testing (Python is often used as a tool to support the software development process. Especially interesting tools for SCons library, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Roundup, Trac)
- Business applications (Python is used in the development of ERP applications and e-commerce systems - Odoo and Triton platforms)

# Reasons to learn Python language (TOP 10)

1. Python is currently the most popular programming language (TIOBE 2021 index). Programs written with Python run on most platforms used today (Java, .NET, Android, iOS) and on most systems used today (Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac OS) 
2. Python is relatively simple. 

Example - the program "Hello World!" in C++ and Python 
C++:
<pre>
#include <iostream>

int main() {<br>
    std::cout << "Hello World!";<br>
    return 0;<br>
}
</pre>
Python: 
<pre>
print("Hello World!")
</pre>

3. it is quick to install, configure and learn
4. it is efficient - also for BigData applications (processing huge data sets)
5. knowledge and ability to program in Python is well rewarded in the labor market (average salary in 2017 in the U.S. for Python programmers - $116,027 per year)
6. the development of network technologies and Big Data processing is causing an increasing demand for Python programmers
7. application possibilities (microprocessor chip programming - Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Cybersecurity, IoT, Marketing, scientific research, data processing, statistics, machine learning and AI, software testing, Web development - Django/Flask )
8 It is considered a "powerful" language - despite its simplicity, a lot can be done with it. It is used in its applications by companies such as Google, Dropbox, Spotify and Netflix.
9 It has many extensions - modules and libraries that speed up code development. Examples: GUI development (PyQT, PySide, PyGTK), mathematical calculations (Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib), web application development (Django, Flask), machine learning (scikit-learn), game development (PyGame)
10. has a large and efficient community and a wealth of learning materials (including documentation and tutorials).
